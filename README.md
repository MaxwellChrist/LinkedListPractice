I am preparing for coding interviews, however I have had little practice with linked lists. This repo is just to experiment with linked lists and try to learn more about them. There's various articles and websites I'm following along with as well, so most of this code is me following a guide of some sort. Feel free to see what I did and also I'm not using any DOM manipulation to render this to the HTML or anything. I'm using a visual code extension called code runner so that I can run my code in the terminal. Possibly later I will turn my results to DOM manipulation but for now I just want to focus on my app.js file running as intended.
